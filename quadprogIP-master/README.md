# quadprogIP

quadprogIP is a global solver for quadratic optimization problems written in Matlab.

## Repository contents

* quadbbIP.m contains the matlab code for solver quadprogIP for Non-Convex quadratic programs
* Stable contains the stable set number test instances
* raw_data.pdf contains a summary table of the runtime of each solver for each individual instances

The instances are prepared for the article *Globally Solving Nonconvex
Quadratic Programming Problems
via Completely Positive Programming" by Jieqiu Chen and Samuel Burer,
Math. Prog. Comp. (2012) 4:33â€“52*
can be used to test quadbbIP, and are available at Dr.Sam Burer's personal webpage: http://sburer.github.io/projects.html
